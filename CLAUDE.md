# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Vue 3 component library wrapping the SurveyJS creator (`survey-creator-vue` + `survey-vue3-ui`). Adds theming, modal/icon overlays, and bilingual (Persian/English with RTL) localization. Published to npm; built as UMD + ESM with type declarations. Vue 3 is a **peer dependency** — not bundled.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` — Vite dev server (mounts `src/main.ts` demo)
- `pnpm build` — Vite library build + `vue-tsc` type declarations
- `pnpm build:types` — type declarations only
- **No tests, no linter, no formatter configured.** Do not invent `pnpm test` / `pnpm lint` — they do not exist. If verification is needed, run `pnpm build` (catches type errors via `vue-tsc`).

## Code style

- TypeScript strict mode (`noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noUncheckedSideEffectImports` all on).
- Vue 3 Composition API only, `<script setup lang="ts">`. Use `defineProps<>()` / `defineEmits<>()` generics.
- Theming is driven by CSS variables passed in via the `cssVariables` prop — defined in `src/themes/theme.ts`. Do not add scoped `<style>` blocks for theme tokens.
- Localization uses `surveyLocalization.setupLocale()` called directly in code (`src/index.ts`, `src/main.ts`), not JSON files.

## Gotchas

- `.env` contains `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` (npm publish credential). Never echo, commit, or include it in tool output.
- `vue` is marked external in the Rollup config — never add it to bundled imports or assume it's tree-shakeable here.
- `schema.txt` and `test.json` at the repo root are demo data, not generated artifacts.

## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
